Code quality check- bugs(error)
                                  -  vulnerability- weak point in code where attacks can be possible
                                  - duplications- same code again n again
                                  - code smell (maybe we get issue at this point)
                                 - technical debt - to cover all these issues and fixing  one may need time this is call technical debt
Code coverage-   80% should be minimum required
